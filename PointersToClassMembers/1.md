# <ins>Pointers to <em>class members and data members</em></ins>

* The operator `::*` with the class name is used to declare a pointer to the class data members.

```c++
class A{
	private:
	int m;
	public:
	void show();
};
```
Pointer to the member `m` of `class A` will look something like this:
```c++
int A::*p=&A::m;
```
