# BASICS

* `cin` ignores whitespaces just like `scanf()` in C.

### Storage classes

#### <ins>1. Automatic</ins>

**Lifetime & visibility is restricted to the function in which it is declared.**


#### <ins>2. External</ins>

**Also called _global_ variable. Lifetime and visibility is spread all acros the program.**

#### <ins>3. Static</ins>

**Has visibility of a local variable and lifetime of an external variable.**

#### <ins>4. Register</ins>

**Similar in behaviour to automatic variables. Are stored in CPU registers.**


>`int`, `short int` _and_ `long int` _are different types in C++ unlike C._
>`char`, `unsigned char` and `signed char` _are different types in C++._


#### Reference variable
* **These are _alias_ or alternate names for a previously defined variable.**
* **A reference variable _must_ be initialized at the time of declaration.**

**Syntax:**
```c++
dataType& referenceName=variableName;
```

Example:

```c++
int a=10;
int&b=a; // b is another name of a
```

_It's like labeling a memory address with another name. First we labeled the memory address with the name a and then by_
_creating a reference variable we(kind of) gave another label(i.e b) to the same memory address._
