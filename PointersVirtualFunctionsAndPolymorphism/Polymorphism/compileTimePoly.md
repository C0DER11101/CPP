# Compile time polymorphism

* <ins>Meaning</ins>: The decision regarding which function to call is done at compile time.
* It's also called **early** or **static** binding or **static** linking.
* It's achieved in two ways:
	* **Function overloading.**
	* **Operator overloading.**

* [Program-1](https://github.com/C0DER11101/CPP/blob/quickCPP/PointersVirtualFunctionsAndPolymorphism/Polymorphism/Programs/main1.cpp) $\rightarrow$ this is the simplest example of compile-time polymorphism.
* [Program-2](https://github.com/C0DER11101/CPP/blob/quickCPP/PointersVirtualFunctionsAndPolymorphism/Polymorphism/Programs/main2.cpp) $\rightarrow$ this is another program that implements compile-time polymorphism.
