# The `this` pointer

* `this` is a pointer that points to the object which calls a member function of its class.

* [This program](https://github.com/C0DER11101/CPP/blob/quickCPP/PointersVirtualFunctionsAndPolymorphism/Programs/this1.cpp) explains `this` best.

* This unique pointer is **automatically** passed to a member function when it is called.

* The pointer `this` acts as an **implicit** argument to **all** the member functions.
