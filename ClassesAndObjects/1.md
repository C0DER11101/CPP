# Classes and objects
## <ins>Class Specification</ins>
Has two types:
1. <ins>Class declaration</ins> $\rightarrow$ **Describes the type and scope of its members.**
2. <ins>Class function definition</ins> $\rightarrow$ **Describes how class functions are implemented.**

${\color{yellow}\underline{General\ form\ of\ class\ declaration}}$
```c++
class className{
	private:

	variableDeclarations;
	functionDeclarations or functionDefinitions;

	public:

	variableDeclarations;
	functionDeclarations or functionDefinitions;
};
```

* The key feature of OOPS is $\underline{{\color{orange}data\ hiding}}$

* By default, members of a class are ${\color{ProcessBlue}private}$.

* ${\color{Cyan}\underline{Only\ member\ functions\ of\ a\ class\ can\ have\ access\ to\ the\ private\ data\ members\ and\ private\ member\ funtions\ of\ that\ class}}$.

## <ins>Encapsulation?</ins>
**Binding of data and functions together into a single class type variable is said to be encapsulation.**

## <ins>Defining member funtions</ins>
Member functions can be defined in two places:
1. Inside the class.
2. Outside the class.

### <ins>Inside the class</ins>
${\color{yellow}\underline{General\ form\:}}$

```c++
returnType functionName(argumentList....){
	functionBody;
}
```
${\color{teal}when\ a\ function\ is\ defined\ inside\ a\ class,\ it's\ treated\ as\ an\ inline\ function(\ iff\ its\ length\ is\ small)}$.

### <ins>Outside the class</ins>
${\color{yellow}\underline{General\ form\:}}$

```c++
returnType className::functionName(argumentList....){
	functionBody;
}
```

* **Memory space for objects is allocated when they are declared and not when the class is specified.**
* **Member functions are created and placed in the memory space only once when they are defined as a part of class specification.**

* **Space for member variables is allocated separately for each object.**

## <ins>Static data members</ins>
Features of static data members:

* ${\color{LimeGreen}Initialized\ to\ zero\ when\ the\ first\ object\ of\ its\ class\ is\ created}$.
* ${\color{LimeGreen}Only\ one\ copy\ is\ created\ and\ is\ shared\ by\ all\ the\ objects\ of\ that\ class}$.
* ${\color{LimeGreen}Visible\ only\ within\ the\ class,\ but\ its\ lifetime\ is\ the\ entire\ program}$.
* ${\color{LimeGreen}Static\ data\ members\ must\ be\ defined\ outside\ the\ class}$.

${\color{JungleGreen}\underline{REASON}}$

_They are stored separately rather than as a part of an object. They are associated with the class itself rather than with any_
_class object. So they are also called **class variables**._

${\color{yellow}\underline{General\ syntax\ of\ defining\ a\ static\ data\ member\ of\ a\ class\:}}$
```c++
dataType className::staticDataMember;
```

## <ins>Static member functions</ins>
Properties:

* ${\color{LimeGreen}These\ functions\ can\ have\ access\ to\ other\ \textbf{static}\ members\ declared\ in\ the\ same\ class}$.
* ${\color{LimeGreen}These\ functions\ \textbf{must}\ be\ called\ using\ the\ classname\ as\:}$
```c++
className::functionName(arguments);
```

**We can pass an object as an argument to a non-member function but this function won't be able to access the private members of the class whose object passed to it as an argument.**
